# MetropolisMayor
This project was meant to become a supporting tool for the Metropolis card game. Because counting the points that are generated each turn takes a long time the app would make each player's life easier.

## Archive notice
This project was (obviously) never finished, but this repository will remain as the core game logic had been implemented. It might be of use to someone in the future. I myself might still redo this project.
